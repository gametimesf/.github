Hello, I would like to make Gametime a better place by contributing the following code:

## Observability:
[] Before opening a PR consider whether you have added sufficient observability, do you need to add any datadog additional metrics or spans?
[] Do your metrics follow the [naming conventions](https://www.notion.so/gametime/DataDog-Custom-Metrics-Usage-Naming-63c6d77879f94d04abe8fb7e14d43978?pvs=4#dcee7c9196be4a948010137927fc9337)?
[] Have you added your metric to the [Metric Notion page](https://www.notion.so/gametime/aa13f1d2282a4914a88d1524e53f959f?v=9cd24e058bd8429e937dcd5bec9892b4?)
